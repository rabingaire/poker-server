## Setup

Clone the repository and run

    $ yarn   # or npm install

Make a copy of `.env.example` as `.env` and update your application details and database credentials. Now, run the migrations and seed the database.

    $ yarn migrate
    $ yarn seed

Finally, start the application.

    $ yarn start:dev (For development)
    $ NODE_ENV=production yarn start (For production)

Navigate to http://localhost:8848/api-docs/ to verify installation.

## Creating new Migrations and Seeds

These are the commands to create a new migration and corresponding seed file.

    $ yarn make:migration <name>
    $ yarn make:seeder <name>

Example,

    $ yarn make:migration create_tags_table
    $ yarn make:seeder 02_insert_tags

## Tests

To run the tests you need to create a separate test database. Don't forget to update your `.env` file to include the connections for test database.

    $ NODE_ENV=test yarn migrate
    $ yarn test

Run tests with coverage.

    $ yarn test:coverage
